        <h4 class="author">By Jane Doe</h4>
        <p class="text">In an extraordinary twist of fate, Grandma Edna found herself at the forefront
            of a potential crisis when her clever Wi-Fi security measures unexpectedly thwarted an
            alien invasion. As alien spacecraft descended upon the town, panic spread until Grandma
            Edna calmly intervened, resetting her router with a cryptic passphrase known only to her.</p>
        <p class="text">
            The aliens, encountering unforeseen technological barriers, struggled to breach Grandma
            Edna's fortified network. Frustrated and bewildered, they eventually retreated to reassess
            their invasion strategy, leaving residents both relieved and amazed at Grandma Edna's resourcefulness.
