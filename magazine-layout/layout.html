                <h2>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h2>
                <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the
                    truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.
                </p>
                <p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't
                    hold a relationship.
                </p>

                <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
                <p><strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</strong>. I literally put 90%
                    of
                    my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
                </p>
                <p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to
                    do.
                    And it worked.
